# Choosing and sourcing parts
Sometimes, you don't have much of a choice. If you only work with AVRs (that's pretty much the case for myself, because I have dreams in AVR assembly at this point; think "the matrix"), it's not hard to go from project requirements to the necessary part number for the microconctroller. But what about everything else? What should you source from digikey or other reputable suppliers in the western world? What should you buy straight from china to save a bundle? 

## Integrated Circuits
When it's manufactuered by a western company, unless it's so old that the datasheets you see are scanned in from the original papyrus scrolls or stone tablets... you should probably get them from a western distributor. Aliexpress et. al. is where you get fake ICs that don't work correctly. This problem is far more common theithe parts that are sold as the bare chip. 

Likewise, if it's made by a chinese company (for example, if you want a CH4340N to add USB-serial functionality to your devie), you generally don't get an option either, since the western vendors don't sell them. If you, for example. wanted to use the Holtek HT42B534, you ain't gonna find them except fromr vendrors in China. 

So IC's are actually quite simple too.

## Passsives
* In my experience, though the prices on ebay and aliexpress sound lovely.... if you do the math and buy the same amount, Digikey Mouser, etc are actually around the same price on stuff like reistors and ceramic caps. There is very little need to buy tantalum caps these days (not only are they mostly superfluous, the tantalum tha they get their name from is sorced violent warlords in third world countries, and mined by slave labor). Ceramic capacitor networks are often cheapr - if you can find them - and high value ceramic caps modestly cheaper, but not worth bothering with. Aluminum electroyltics are often cheaper direct from china in event that you need such large bulk capacitors 
* Kits are usually cheaper from china, as are large (power) resistors. 
* Stackpole electronics makes a great line of tiny through-hole resistors with power ratings higher than their size would suggest; available from Digikey and other western suppliers; I recommend these when forced to use throughhole parts. 


## Connectors, switches, and project boxes
The prices in china *bury* the western suppliers. You want to get those from china. 

### My personal favorites
#### Tact pushbuttons
The 3x6mm ones are my usual go to, the ones that normally hae either a white or red button. EziUsin on Aliexpress has them in all the colors of the rainbow for only a small premium (and other sellers have them for exorbitant premiums. If I need a tall button extension, I use the 6x6mm ones, while if board space is an issue, there's a 3x3 line. You can get all manner of bizarro buttons, but.... why....? These are common, cheap, and durable.
