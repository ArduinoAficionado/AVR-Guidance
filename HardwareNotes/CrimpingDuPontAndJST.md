# Crimping your own DuPont, dupont, and JST connectors
There are a million guides on this, and I'm not going to belabor the basics; there are a few key issues that cause the vast majority of the difficulties hobbyists have with these. The two different capitolizatoons is intentional. DuPont is the name of a company which made the original MiniPV connector, which is an excellent connector; several decades of mergers, acquisions and the like have left the production of the real ones in the hands of Amphenol while DuPont has focused on other product areas. On the other hand, dupont is a style of connector that is superficially similar and can use the same housings (barely!) but is constructed entirely differently; the cheaper construction leads to poor reliability, and the resultant miserable reputation they have (when I discovered s batch of jumpers that was failing the pull test, I asked a friend of mine who stopped by "You know dupont connectors rig--" he cut me off: "I hate them!"). These crappy connectors were never manufactured by DuPont. Harwin appears to be the connector manufactureer who made the first of the now ubiquitous "dupont" terminals.

## First: A word of warning about AWG ratings
It's sad that this is what I feel a need to cover first, but it is, unfortunately, very common for dishonest manufacturers in China and places with similar lax regulatory enforcement to intentionally try to pass wire off as thicker than it is. It is not uncommon to find wire marked "22 AWG", strip it, and discover 17 strands 0.1mm-0.11mm: it's 26 AWG, not 22! That part of the deception is bad enough (counting the strands in stranded wire every time you buy wire is a pain, plus you need to be able to measure the diameter of the strands to 0.01mm. It makes a great deal of difference if the strands are 0.1 mm or 0.14 mm in diameter; that's the difference between 23 gauge and 25 gauge). What makes this practice even more pernicious is that in order to make the wire *look* like the claimed gauge, they make the insulation thicker. Terminals were designed with normal, non-dishonest insulation thicknesses, and so the maximum size of wire you can use ends up being limited by this stupid excess insulation and it is hard to get a good cromp on both at the same time. This is mostly a problem when wiring things up with smaller JST connectors, where you probably want the maximum current rating, but can't fit such a wire between the insulation tabs, because of the bloated insulation layer.

### This is largely confined to Chinese production wire
It isn't even universal there, but it is common enough to find it in assembled equipment too.
### It's unclear how much it is known by chinese sellers and ditributors
Some of them are most certainly willing and enthusiastic participants in the fraud. Others, do not appear to be aware that it's even a thing - they have pictures in which it is abundantly obvious that the conductors are undersized. There is also a complication in the form of the metric and english units. I have seen listings that describe 17x0.1mm wire as 22 AWG! (it's 26AWG). You wouldn't say that if you knew you were scamming people.
I have a feeling that there's an ongoing war between manufacturers and consumers of wire. I've read articles where people describe dozens of pieces of equipment failing soon after installation because of the undersized wire, and I doubt they put them together fully aware of how undersizaed the wire was. Likely the wire got switched to a different brand claiming the same specs, and they took their word (maybe they got one lot of accurately marked stuff before the manufacturer switched to sending them the fake stuff. )

### You (mostly) get what you pay for
Wire that isn't super cheap is better. That fancy, expensive "FEP" insulated wire generally meets spec. Wire that's dirt cheap and has fewer specs listed rarely does. More knowledable sellers who specialize in wire are more likely to have the good stuff, and know which of their wire is mismarked. The worst kind of wire for this problem  is the the colored "hookup wire" (also called "UL1007") which is sold at rock bottom prices and almost universally marked dishonestly.

## Particular concerns for "dupont" connectors
These are the most common jumper cables. More often found as female-to-female jumpoers than other gender combinations (with good reason - female terminal pushed onto male header makes a better connection, and female terminals are cheaper than male ones, while male header is not only cheaper but can be easily cut to length (female header has several problems - but that's for a different document - female header is normally to engage male header, notr male dupont line. Really rthe only exception is the Arduino Uno and things that copied it. Everything else puts male header on the board and you suse female dupont line), though male-male is also very common because of it's usefulness with breadboard.

For some reason, these always seemed incredibly hard to crimp. harder than other common connectors - considering how central they are to hobby electronics, this was rather frustrating. Years later, I think I've figured out all the problems (which are not well covered by most tutorials).

### No, you can't use an SN-28B crimp tool on dupont terminals - and certainly not real DuPont ones.
At least not if you want acceptable results.The same is true of 99% of other crimp tools. The best you can get is a mediocre crimp, and the more frequent result is a total failure.

**If you want to crimp dupont/DuPont terminals, you must get a crimper that has a round insulation crimp die.** See the tools list for more discussion, but these are rare.

Most crimp connectors bend both the wire crimp and the insulation crimp tabs into a "B" shape. Accordingly, that's what most crimp tools try to do, including the SN-28B.

Unfortunately, DuPont terminals need the insulation tabs *wrapped around* the wire. The form needs to be round, not B-shaped. Actually, maybe unfortunately is the wrong word, because it's nothing to do with fortune, and everything to do with physics. They needed the terminals to fit into a hole in a housing that's only 0.1" square on the outside, but still fit around a standard header pin. If you look at all the other crimp connectors, you'll find that the housing for, say, a 0.1" pitch connector is usually considerably wider than 0.1". So they were pretty much forced into that design decision, they didn't do it just to make life hard on us.

Until recently, there weren't decent generic crimp tools with the correct shaped die available, despite how common these connectors were. As a result, people used inappropriate crimp tools that did a lousy job. You'd make a mess trying to tighten a flat-head screw with a phillips screwdriver, too. Where there was a will, there was a way, however, and the lack of tools that could make a decent crimp (short of used dupont and harwin crimpers which cost hundreds of dollars new) was not enough to deter people from, through hard work, patience, and many ruined connectors, making their own cables using tools like SN-28B's. Many of these people then wrote the guides you all see around the internet. If you replace the tool in their hands with an appropriate one, their guides are generally sound, and their crimping job far better.

Using the right crimp tool will make things far easier, and makes it possible to get good results, rather than barely acceptable ones (the examples of a "good crimp" shown in many guides with the SN-028B look like crimps that I would cut off and redo), and success rates of >95% instead of <50%. Two cheap ratchet-type crimp tools that I know of are the SN-025, and the TZ-4228B. They both do a pretty good job, though I think I get better results with the Toozo one - it is also a much more useful crimper. The SN-025 has 2 other slots for... some sort of mysterious connectors that also require the same shape crimp. The TZ-4228B, on the other hand, has 3 other slots, sized appropriately for JST-PH, JST-XH or JST-SM, and JST-VH, among others. In other words, the most popular connectors in hobby and light electronics!

### Don't get the garbage terminals
Have you noticed how some DuPont jumpers seem to be worse than others? Like, they made poor connections almost immediately and go downhill from there? That's because there are several versions of the "dupont" terminals available at hobbyist prices (a couple of cents a piece). All of these are knockoffs of a knockoff of the dupont Mini PV connector...). The design is almost identical, but the cheaper ones have a shorter wire crimp and generally seem to be using less metal wherever they can. Avoid those at all costs. They won't even crimp right in the good crimp tools because they're the wrong size! To help recognize the good ones, try to get the "half gold" plating (sometimes marketed without the "half" part - but the gold plating you see in the picture is clearly only on the mating half of the connector). The gold plating is desirable (Gold on connectors almost always is), but it's more important as a way of differentiating the good kind of terminals from garbage. The garbage terminals do not (as far as I've seen) come with gold plating. See also below point...

### Use the correct gauge of wire
Not specific to dupont connectors. But more confusing here.


AWG 18 through AWG 32 for real DuPont connectors (they come in four sizes for different thicknesses, though the ultra small size is very hard to find). Clone dupont terminals, it's a bit complicated They never are sold with clearly deliniated wire size specs. however my experience is that: The best of the clones works up to 24 AWG, and 22 barely doable (they're just the right size for most "22 AWG" mismarked wire though. They can go down to 30 AWG wire (you might need to tighen the tool a notch), so they're good down to most "26 AWG" mismarked crap wire). The cheaper, crappier ones' only advantage is that, being designed for that hair-thin ribbon cable that the manifactrers of dupont line love, they work on 32-34 AWG, so what the vendors often call 30 gauge.  A lot of dupont jumpers use thinner wire. *Many of these jumpers will actually fail the pull test* (go try it with some of the rainbow-ribbon-cable flavor of jumpers - the terminals pull right off in many cases! Note that this does not happen with the individual precrimped wires sold without the housings, at least not any of the ones I've gotten (they also use the less-bad terminals - at least judging by the length of the terminal), but it does with most other DuPont line (which use the shorter, crappier terminals).

For other types of connectors, particualrly small ones, the harder part is finding wire with insulation thin enough to fit, the insulation crimp tabs.

### DuPont and clone connectors and small connectors with unused pins
Say you have something that would normally take a 1x5 connector. You only need 3 of those (you don't need pin 2 and 4, say) and you make a cable with those three wires, and start using it. Over time, you will notice the cable get less and less reliable at that end - quite rapidly, and even if ytou rarely unplug it. It seems li not having the terminals in all slots lets it move on the pins, and deforms them more quickly. If buying better terminals is out of the question (or rather, your budget) practice your crimping skills a bit, cutting off the terminals when you crimp them, Place one o thsese dummy terminals in each of the unused holes, where it will help to hold the connector in place. These connectors are unline an of the other connectors on the list inthat they are held on ONLY by the mating force between pins and terminal. Every other connector has a housing that also locks in place, (sometimes even with a little latch, like JST-GH). There is a style very much like dupont called "dupont MX" which has a latch and uses a different kind of terminal which is much less common (and still has all the other problems)


## "JST" connectors
Many people online talk about a "JST connector" as though that was sufficient information for someone to go buy the matching connector. JST is a company (Japan Solderless Terminals); they make connectors; in fact they are one of the world leaders in that field. JST makes *hundreds* of types of connectors, many of which have terminals that are crimped in place, are widely used, and look identical in photos if there's no ruler next to them. You should never refer to a "JST connector", nor should you let anyone else get away with that! Specify the type of connector! When I was first getting into electronics, it once took me three tries (waiting a month for shipping each time) just to get a 2-pin connector that matched the development board I was using...

Quick descriptions
**MiniPV** - The original! First produced by DuPont, which spun out the connector division as Berg. Berg was then bought by Amphenol, one of the giants of the connector industry. They still manufacture the same terminals as always, but you have most likely never seen one. The main difference is immediately obvious if you have the two kinds next to each other (outside of a housing): you can see a leaf spring pressing up against the pin! Word is that the ones you buy now are just as good as theoriginals, and they certainly do inspire far more confidence, and never feel loose. There are just two problems: 1. They are eye-wateringly expensive: $0.16 to upwards of $2 each at qty 1, falling to the more modest pricing of $0.09 to $1.77 if you buy 100 at a time. Most are around 20-30 cents each if you buy 100 at a time. A 6-pin serial cable, even if you omit the CTS line, may cost you more than the arduino pro mini clone you're using it with.  2. Buying them is a terrible experience - catalogs are inexplicable poor, datasheets that vnedors link to from product pages, when you're looking at terminals, especially these, suddenly stop havign the part number of the thing you clicked a link from. Really, this is probably in large part because they have, minimum, 80 kinds of terminals, and iin reality I think it's well over 100 kinds assuming you count the loose vs tape packaging. They charge a premium for terminals that aren't on the tape. When you think about that, you're probably imagining how JST terminals and cheap dupont clones come, with one end connected and it's 2 bends and the terminals are off. Nope. This is far less manegable. They are attached end to end (2 connections per terminal) and trying to break them off by fatiguing the metal is a great way to damage your nice new 20-30 cent terminals. Use a pair of wire cutters. They are made with three different levels of spring force - you will almost always want "ultra high", and almost never "standard". If you dig out the document that describes them, they tell you when to use which kind. 1-20 pin connectors want Ultra High, 10-40 pin ones can use high, and standard should only be used when there are more than 20 pins per connector. No, I;ve never seen a housing like that either.

Once you finally get your hands on them though, they are very nice connectors. You can feel the difference as you plug and unplug them. The key is the fact that they have a little leaf spring pushing the pin and supplying the mating force.The dupont connectors rely on the brass holding it's position. It doesn't doe rthat very well, where as the spring on thereal ones is made of phosphor bronze and actiually acts like a spring, and works quite well,  They are just miles better than the cheap ones. Because like, they actually have a spring, while the cheap ones rely on a piece of stamped non-springy brass holding it's shapee. Unsurprisingly, it doesm't.  Use these for cables tht are plugged and unplugged often, and/or cause downbtime or delay if they were to get unreliable. Try to avoid having to include these things in large connectors in products you sell though, because they're just too damned expensive).

*The process of buying "DuPont" connector terminals from reputable western vendors sucks.*

**"dupont"** - The connectors we all know by that name. These appear to be copies of a design by Harwin who liked the idea of the MiniPV connectors so much, they decided to make their own, but they had to cut costs. A spring of a different metal just wasn't going to do it. They figured out a way to make it from 1 folded up piece of stamped metal. Individuals who have tried the Harwin ones found them to have little advantage over least-bad clones, and just like those, thery wore quickly and stopped making reliable connections. The ones you're likely to interact with, of course, aren't made by Harwin, but by random chinese knockoff manufacturers. Some manufacturers produce a usable termina if mediocre terminal. The best clones are "half gold" with half of the connectorthat sees the most action plated with gold flash. . The ones that are the same size but without the gold are priced similarly but, you know, not gold plated. This is typically what is used when you buy individual strands of dupont line on separate wires (not ribbon cable). The rest of the Chinese dupont connectors, including anything sold crimped to ribbon cable, are a tier lower, often fail pull-test, and are absolutely unfit for any purpose. Even the cat said they were no fun to play with.

The best of the chinese dupont connectors are fine for occasional use or as disposable cables (which such dupont line should be considered). The worst of them are imopressive in terms of how terrible they are. like, at every step where they had a chance to save the tiniest amount of money by selling a crappier product, trhey grabbed for it. It's

*The "dupont" connector terminals you buy from disreputable Chinese vendors suck.*

**TE SuperSeal** - A big honnkin' bulky connector for automotive applications. Meant to protect from moisture infitltation (I an skeptical about how well it can do that without more than just those little rubber plugs around the wires - but it's certainly far more water resistant than antything else here, and there are low cost rubber boots that can be ziptied in place; the result seems like it could plausiblly keep water out under most conditions.) I doubt anything will make these waterproof such that you can immerse them in water, but if youre concerned about splashes, they're great, probably even rain would be okay. They are super easy to crimp with an SN-48B or SN-58B (recommend the latter, as it also replaces the SN-28B). Really, there's only one problem with these, and that is the fact that they are just huge. Like, 2 inches long for a mated pair of conectors, and the largest size, which is just 6 pins, is over an inch wide. The boots would at least double the length. These are very bulky, but that's the price you pay for the durability. One other tricky part is pin extraction. The female pins are easy to remove, pull red tip towards you, and that unlocks the terminals and you can pull them out. If they stick, you might have to pull the tip out (it goes right back in). The male pins, at the bottom of the inch-deep hole in the connector housing are whole other ball gaane. Supposedly, you can just put their hook-like extractiobn tool in and pull it into an unlatched position and then remove the pins. I think I've had it go down like that once. The rest of the time, I've wound up spending like ten minutes or more, with an arsenal of pin extraction tools, and mini-screwdrivers, often with several jammed into the connector housing, trying to manipulate some latching mechanism that I can't visualize into letting go of the terminal.

They are also able to carry a larger current than most wire-to-wire connectors, making them good for main power supply lines into higher current devices. The bulk also sends a message to untrained persons who might be around it: "This is serious business, look at this big connector, be careful with it"

**JST-SM** These are a 2.54 mm pitch wire-to=wire connector (no wire to board), they're rated at up to 3A *with the maximum 22 gauge wire* - they should not carry the full current with anything less. That includes "22 AWG" wire that isn't actually 22 AWG aas noted above. Many of the prewired connectors are absolutely of miserable quality (they somehow have managed to find a vendor who sells terminals of a different design and rock bottom quality, to pair with their wirw 8-10 sizes smaller than what's printed on it) - particularly common for the 2-pin ones. Which, unfortumnately are what people are most likelty to want to put power through. Fortunately, after the TE connectors, these are the easiest ones to crimp. The Tozzo and a SN-28B or SN-58B will do the trick without particular difficulty, but the thinner jaws of the Tozzo make it easier to see what I'm doing and again make it my preferred tool.

These connectors are okay, but only okay. Their biggest selling point is that they are the de facto standard for addressable LEDs. Unfortunately, the direction of the pins on said strings is often exactly what you don't want (you want to feed power and data into one end; with the standard pinout, the tail end always has +5V, ground and data on pins sticking out. Not good. 5v is rarely dangerous in and of itself, but LED strips can pull enough current that they are frequently backed by beefy power supplies, so a near short on the end of the string could pose a fire hazard without tripping the overcurrent protection on the power supply).

I have not been terribly happy with how these have worked out on my light strings. In fact I have been so disappointed that I cut them all off and put MicroFit 3.0 connectors on instead. They

**JST-VH, XH, PH, and ZH** - There are 4 very similar connectors in this line (plus 2 smaller ones, listed below for different reasons), the VH (3.98mm), XH (2.5mm), PH (2.0mm) and ZH (1.5mm), and they are all extremely similar to eachother in shape and style. JST and third parties manufacture headers in both SMT and through-hole versions for ZH and PH, XH only has a few sizes of SMT connectors manufactured by JST, though third parties supply a full range in both right angle and side entry. VH headers are all through hole. Of these connectors, largest three types have terminals that are easily crimped - the Tozzo 4228B has a slot for each, as do many other crimp tools. PH and XH are some of the most common connectors in consumer electronics. VH is somethat uncommon, as is ZH, but I've seen all of them in consumer electronics. PH and XH are ubiquitous in connections from battery packs to PCBs. and PH is very common for cables between PCBs in single piece of equipment, often on the end of white-and-pink or white-and-blue ribbon cable  (where each strand has a different pattern of pink or blue marks on it). These are all good choices when they meet the requirements of your application for a wire-to-board conectior, and headers for 2-10+ pin lengths are available. There are also wire-to-wire versions (ie, a male pin and housing) for both XH and PH. The XH eems kinda bulky as a wire-to-wire connector, but is readily available. The PH wire-to-wire connectors are less common (apparently, only one of the two is officially made by JST. I can never remember which one it is). Either of these are good choices for wire-to-wire connectors on these grounds. I would pick XH over DuPont connectors for any non-prototyping application. There apparently also exists a wire-to-wire ZM housing and terminal. They are rare and exotic, and I have not fouind them for sale even from western suppliers.

All of these have the widest point of a connector with N pins equal to (N+1) * pitch - a 4p XH is 12.5mm wide, PH 10mm, and ZH 7.5mm. The VH and XH terminals are have a locking farb that is visible externally and can be pushed in with a pin extraction tool to remove wire + pin from the housing. On the PH and ZH, the mechanism is instead a springy piece of plastic on the housing that can be pulled away with a pin extraction tool or anything pointy, like on the dupont connectors. This method is also used on SH, GH, and MicroJST.

*JST-ZH connectors sold on market sites* are not made by JST (This is universal. I don't think anything sold on aliexpress was actually made by Japan Solderless Terminal) and differ from what is shown in the manufacturer datasheet. Viewing it along the long axis, there is no plastic extending past the pins on the third party connectors. This provides less support to the shroud, but permits some layouts that are impossible with the genuine headers. And if you *really* want to, you can push the pins out (you can't pull them out without damage, at least on the ones I have, rotate them 180 degrees and put them back in if you need to put the connector on an unusually thick PCB (this gets you about an extra 1mm). Remember that this reverses the pin order too; don't use it for that purpose outside of an "oops" prototype where you got the connector pinout backwards. On the next board revision, you can fix the pin order to match existing cables, or you can reverse the order of pins in the cable. Modifying the connectors in this way is slow and tedious work with a pair of pliers, much harder than modifiying typical 0.1" pin header: the pins hold onto the plastic tenatiously yet bend easily.

You need something specialized to crimp the tiny the ZH. The IWISS 3220M was decent, as was the SN-03, and they're totally viable, if slow work, with manual crimpers too. Use the 1 mm slot.

**JST-SH** is the finest pitch crimp connector JST makes. They make SMT headers only (most board houses can't put holes that close together). I've never seen them in the wild, but when you need a particularly dense connector, this is the most widely available option (I am intentionally omitting any strange or exotic connectors from this discussion; even these push the limits of what humans can crimp). These are used in some small drones.

They work well enough, but my god, they are incredibly hard to crimp at home. They are just too small. The problem is holding them in place to position them in the crimp tool, more than anything else. Even a manual crimper with the necessary 0.7mm wide slot still means that you are trying to crimp something you need tweezers to hold onto. I have not been very successful. Try to avoid having to use these - or at least having to crimp the damned things yourself. Terminal line is widely available because everyone else has the same problem.

**JST-GH** - The GH line is a rather fancy set of connectors. SMT headers only, in vertical or horizontal versions, 1.25nn pitch. Totally different desigh, Where the others have the spring in the terminal, and a pin in the receoptacle, the GH has a flat terminal that is inserted into the receptacle, engaging a mating connector on the top and bottom. These also have a LATCH - a real one - to ensure that they stay in even in high vibration environments. Unsurprisingly, even the cheapest knockoffs are several times the price of other connectors. Use it when you need a fine pitch connector, but also worry about the connector retention due to vibration or other factors. These are widely used in drones, and some special purpose consumer electronics. While you need a smaller crimp tool than most, these are less burtally difficult to crimp than you'd expect - depending on the tool, they can be easier than ZH - because the flat blade is easier to hold onto. Since it's mostly flat, you don't need to worry about crushing it like you do the ZH and most others as you try to hold it in place with pliers, tweezers, or some hybrid gripping tool.

**"Micro JST"** - The so-called "Micro JST 1.25" connector looks like someone zapped a JST-ZH with a shrink-ray, except that the holes are squared off instead of rounded on the housing. This is often the fastest way to tell which is from the housings. On the headers, notice that the male pins are wider in one dimension than the other. Available in wire to board and wire to wire, they are a viable option if you can stand crimping them. Cheap and abundant, as terminal line, premade cables, or (ugh) tiny little terminals. Be sure you are comfortable with the amount of crimping of tiny terminals involved before you decide to start using these in a design. They are available with both SMT and through-hole headers. The former is recommended. 1.25mm pitch is just a hair too tight for comfort, when working with a row of through-hole pins, and it's very easy to get solder bridges. The really surprising thing about these "micro JST" connectors is that JST makes no such connector! These are all made by some nameless Chinese manufacturer, and they get sold as "Micro JST" because anyone who looked at them would be sure they were made by JST.

**MX2.0** - These are wire-to-wire connectors. They feel cheap. They ARE cheap. Very cheap, actually. They're available up to at least 6p, though the 2p form is by far the most common, used to connect batteries in some consumer electronics where space is tight. Their claim to fame is that they are thin. 2.7mm or so for a pair of them connected - the side with the female pins has a slight ridge near the wire ebd which can be shaved off to get it to around 2.54mm (eg, 0.1") for passing through a narrow slot. They are thinner than any of the others here, which are at their smallest 3mm thick for the smaller of the halves, and 3.25mm for the mated wire-to-wire connector ("MicroJST" is the runner up), and these can carry 2A of current as well. Great for things where you are tightly constrained on connector thicknesss, and might have been tempted to use a DuPont conector for a long term connection just because they are thin. Don't do that. The dupont clone terminals are not reliable, the Mini-PV terminals are eye-wateringly expensive, and even with good terminals, this is not a reliable connector. MX2.0 is better in this application; The plastic housings latch together - not much of a latch, but much better than nothing, which is what the dupont connectors have).

They are on the edge of the Tozzo 4228B, I wasn't very happy with results. Honestly, the PAD-11 felt like no slot was quite right. They crimp no problem in the IWS-3220M, though. just make sure it is positioned correctly: The biggest problem I had initially is that I would isert them too far towards the wire end into the crimp tool. I was getting decoyed by what *looks* like the tabs for the wire crimp, but is actually a structural part of the connector (both sides have it)..

These have a metal locking farb exposed through a hole in the housing, which can be pushed in with a pin extraction tool, similar to the mechanism used on the SM, VH, and XH connectors.

**Molex MicroFit 3.0** - I had a very disappointing initial experience crimping genuine molex terminals (with either IWS-3220 or PAD-11, depending on how difficult the wires involved were to crimp). They are harder to crimp well than typical JST (typical failure being the one where the wire ends up broken off after crimping because the insulation extended into the wire area, or the insulation crimp was located in the wire crimp section of the tool, or because of excessive crimping force - , that wasn't the problem. It was getting them fully inserted into the genuine molex housing. When I finally got them inserted and locked in place, the connector seemed excellent, but they were far too difficult to use to do more than a couple of pins. However, I'd already ordered a batch of knokoffs from China, and I figured I'd gibe it a shot when they arrived in the mail a month later. Crimping was fine as expected - but they slipped into the housing with a satisfying click just fine. I  Molex-brand pins in Molex brand housings were impossible to crimp and make fit in without extreme persuasion, clone terminals in clone housings were a piece of cake, and Molex terminals in clone housings with more crimping practice were still not so great and required tools to push them in. The knockoffs were easier to useI don' know how they'll last (obviously I'd rather use genuine gold plated ones - but I'm not going to pay those prices if they're as hard as my first attempts were to get fully inserted and locked in place.)

No - There is no slot that could plausuibly be used.
badly = indicates that there are no approopriate slots for this type of terminal, and the inapproriate ones do a lousy job and should not be used, though they may sometimes produce working (if less durable) crimps. Using this option is a desperation move.
C - The results are barely usable, may be acceptable in a pinch for a small number of crimps.
B - Results are acceptable, but not great.
A - Good results
* - This connector is extremely challenging to hold and deal with due to it's size, and trying to use it with this tool was frustrating.
** - due to the size of the connectors, I have been totally unsuccessful using them with this tool. The problem is usually that the terminal tries to rotate as you start to close the tool; you can't
*** - note: Real MiniPV connectors require three crimps, not just 2 due to the length of the wire crimp. Cheap ones do not.
**** - The PAD-11 with one of the larger dies should do these without problems, though it is still not an ideal tool. The SuperSeal connectors crimp very easily in a SN-58B.

There are three general crimp tool styles.  the "Plier" (ratchet pliers) style, which are the most common, are essentially pliers with precision shaped jaws for crimping instead of holding, and a ratchet mechanism to apply a consistent amount of force. They usually have a method to adjust the crimp force. Often nultiple sets of different jaws are available for one crimp tool. These will be incompatible with equivalent devices from other manufacturers, unfortunately. The ratchet does provide some measure of repeatability in terms of the pressure you apply (ie, if you've got them adjusted correctly, you won't overcrimp or undercrimp unless you change the wire gauge; this is usually fairly forgiving). The speed at which you can crimp connections depends on how long it takes you get the terminal into the tool with the wire inserted into it the correct distance. If you have to bend the tabs with pliers to hold the terminal onto the wire, that will slow you down significantly. If you have to "parallel" the crimp tabs, that will too. Try to avoid having to do that.

The Anvil style of ratchet crimop is less common, bringing the handles together forces the moving die away from the person holding it, where it engages a matching anvil. This mechanism is used by many of the official crimp tools - although the ones they use are far fancier and specialized than say, an IWS-3220. Less force is required to achieve the crimp compared to pliers. The IWS-3220 wins for smaller sizes largely because it's easier and faster to get terminal+wire positioned in, which is always the problem when crimping, which results from the thinner die than most plier type crimp tools.

The "manual" ones are non-ratcheting pliers, which only crimp one set of tabs at a time. You can use  The two top dogs are the Hozan P-707 (which has a dupont insulation crimp die), and the Engineer PAD-11 (which has 3 die sets. Unfortunately, it has 6 sizes per die, and 12 total sizes, so if you can find the largest and smallest, the middle size becomes redundant - but almost everything relevant to hobby electronics is covered by the small die set - the most notable exception being that none of the die sets feature a slot for DuPont connectors - it is aimed squarely at JST connectors.) Both of these tools are in the $70-80 range. You crimp the wire crimp first, then you move the wire and terminal to a new slot in the die and crimp the insulation. Because of the extra step they are slower and more labor intensive compared to ratchet crimps. As you might expect, they also give you far more control, and can get good results under adverse conditions (wire with abnormal insulation thickness, multiple wires, pushing the limits of the size of wire, etc) when ratchet crimpers will either break the wires of fail to crimp. They also require more of a technique in terms of a "feel" for how tightly a given terminal should be crimped. It is striking how much more expensive they are compared to ratchet crimpers, which are a more complicated design, but they are built to a much higher standard of quality. The Hozan P-707 is known to do an excellent job on the round insulation crimp for dupont connectors, though it needs two actions to crimp the wide tabs of the wire crimp on actual mini PV connectors. I prefer the ratchet crimps for routine connections if a suitable one is available, as they make a tedious task faster. For more demanding tasks, such as when one needs to get several wires into one terminal, manual crimp tools give you the control needed to do a better job. Manual tools are also effective for "fixing" inadequately crimped terminals (going over the wire crimp of crap dupont line with a manual crimper - or something like an SN-25 or TZ-4228B - can make them less-bad); in cases where a ratchet crimper doesn't crimp one set of tabs well enough, crimping with the ratchet crimp and then going over them with a manual one can be faster than using a manual one from ths start.

### PA-09 and IWS2820M
The PA-09 is a slightly cheaper, worse version of the PAD-11 from the same manufacturer. It's not worth saving 10 bucks. The IWS-2820M is a knockoff of the PA-09 for a much lower price. It is not terrible and the consensus seems to be that it is an entirely usable manual crimper (I haven't used one yet) available for a price that makes it something other than a luxury tool.

### SN-28B, 48B, 48BS, 58B, 68B
Wow, that's a lot of crimp tools... Not really, though. The 48BS, 58, and 68 are all different names for the same thing. It has 4 slots in the jaws. The SN-28B and SN-48B hacve 3 slots each. Two of the slots on the two are the same. The official IWISS (originator of the SN-series naming scheme) product listing calls it an SN-58B; the other names are applied inconsistently by other manufacturers. There is no reason to own more than one of these, especially not an SN-28B or SN-48B.

### The bottom line about tools
You're probably going to need more than one crimp tool unless you're targeting one specific connector. The Toozo is the most versatile ratchet crimper, and it does cover 5 families of connector, including what are probably 4 of the most common - that is the closest it gets to an all-in-one crimp tool. But anything really large or smaller than PH needs another crimp tool. The manual ones are able to crimp a wider variety of terminals, but except for the IWISS one, are so expensive you could buy 3 ratchet crimps for the price, and only the most expensive one can do dupont terminals, which is what you likely care about most.

I don't have the Hozan yet, but currently, I use the Toozo and PAD-11 most, followed by the SN-58 and IWS-3220. I never use the SN-25, or my old SN-48 or SN-28.

### What about the official crimp tools
What about them? They crimp one kind of terminal. They generally do it extremely well, and many do everything except stripping and inserting the wire for you (and some even do that!) - you can crimp terminals faster and more easily than using generic tools. They also typically cost a few hundred dollars new for the poverty models ranging to over $1000. The ones for connectors popular with hobbyists are highly sought after on the secondary market. Some are prone to breakage when crimping knockoff terminals, especially if, like DuPont connectors, the knockoff terminals are very different from the original ones (Harwin's official tools are better at crimping "dupont" terminals - which makes sense as the clones are all copies of Harwin's design, not DuPont's).

## Pin extraction
Periodically you will have pins in a housing that you want to remove from that housing. Whether you're recycling terminal line from a different design, are adapting the design to accomodate a different number of pins, or you just put them in in the wrong order, this is a normal thing to do. This is easiest to do with the locking tab, and as an added benefit, except in the case of dupont connectors, both the housing and terminals can generally be reused (dupont housings are ruined unless great care is taken).
When there is an exposed metal farb that can be pushed in, this is also not hard to do (push the wire + terminal in further, and then use the extraction tool) - but in this case, the terminal may not latch in the next housing. Sometimes you can "restore" these farbs, at least a couple of times (try to get the edge of an X=Acto knife or razor under the farb) and bend them back into position. This can be done only a couple of times on a given terminal.

The hardest case is when it is a non-exposed metal farb that you have to act on. JST-SM and XH male connectors have this, In the case of SM, you need to push the pin inwards and then insert the pin extraction tool into the hole that the pin is coming out of, on the side closest to the latch (not the much larger holes on the side opposite the latch, those are apparently just for looks). Usually if you press the tool in enough, you will feel it push the connector out. Pulling the wire will usually break the farb - or at least render it unusable. For the JST-XH male connectors, there is a slot on the end where the wire is inserted: Push the wire + terminal inwards, insert pin extraction tool, and gently pull the wire out.

## General considerations and warnings

### Size vs difficulty to crimp
Not all terminals are equally difficult to crimp, though in general they get harder as the terminal gets smaller, since your manual dexterity, visual acuity, and the size of your fingertips is constant. When you are planning a project, be sure to verify that you really are able to crimp a size of connector as easily as you hope, before you buy all the parts, and discover that you can't make the connectors you thought you could after all. Oops.
Everything from JST-PH on up is easy to crimp (The TZ-4228B does it no problem, as do many other tools).


### DuPont and "DuPont MX2.54" are not the same
The MX style has a latch on the housing. You might assume the terminals themselves are interchangible. They're not. MX housings only take MX terminals, and non-MX housings only take non-MX terminals,

Be careful with JST-GH and "micro JST" connectors - I have seen the latter sold as the former (the seller appeared very confused when I told him that micro JST is not the same thing as JST GH - and if you look on JST's website, yeah, JST-GH is the only 1.25mm pitch wire to board connector with crimp terminals they make... it would appear that the seller had done that, and concluded that's what they were selling, even though JST-GH looks nothing like "micro JST")

### Precrimped wires
You can get all of these terminals pre-crimped onto wires. Sometimes sold as "terminal line" (that's a good search term). The only type of connector where poorly crimped terminal line is common is the "dupont" type as I described above, and decent (ie, with the best kind of clone terminals, but without the gold plate option) dupont terminal line is available (most of the stuff that isn't made with ribbon cable is fine). Needless to say,terminal line made with real MiniPV terminals is not available. I've yet to encounter a bad batch of JST terminal line, whereas I'd been building electronics for years before I encountered dupont line that wasn't crap. Precrimped cables, where the terminals are inserted into a housing already, of all types seems to be a bit less consistent in quality, Terminal line is very common for the JST Wire to board connectors (the male JST-XH is rarely seen on terminal line, and the male PH is unheardof). The one exception to the "JST precrimped cables are usually decent" trend is JST-SM - bad JST-SM pre-crimped connectors are very common.

### Beware pre-wired JST-SM connectors
These are sold in abundance because of their use for LED striops. Some of these are fine, and can be a time saver (or, really more of a "time wpent getting comfortable crimping connectors" saver - JST-SM is probably the easiest of the connectors listed here to crimp) - but make sure you get ones with the wire gauge listed, and measure it to be sure when you get it. I have seen 30 gauge wire stamped "AWG 22" - and when such wires were used without recognizing that, seen the red insulation baked by the heat generated by the undersized wire until the red and black wires were the same color.

The same holds for any pre-wired connector, but the JST-SM series seem to be the worst-afflicted by this sort of cheaping-out, likely because of the mass market for LED strip - unfortunately, LED strips do tend to be a demanding application. Those things draw a lot of current. Very few people try to put a full 3A through a dupont connector, but people try to put more than that through a JST-SM connectors ALL THE TIME, often with no idea that they're doing anything wrong. Wiring up a very short strip of addressable LEDs is easy, and people new to electronics see how easy it is, and scale their projects without realizing that the handling the power supply very quickly becomes the dominant technical problem.

### Multiple wires in one terminal.
Unlike DuPont connectors, in the larger sizes, provided you crimp with a manual crimp tool (a ratchet crimp is a non-starter here - it will apply too much force and break off the wires) you can stuff multiple wires into one terminal, crimp it down, and have a decent chance of it working! This is often not the ideal approach, but it can work. Some terminals are even designed specifically for it.

## The Thermal wire stripper
Unless you are very good with wire strippers, and enjoy stripping large numbers of wires without nicking the conductors, I would recommend getting a thermal wire strippeR. In general, but particularly if you are gonna be crimping a lot of connectors. I have a PTS-10 from Patco ($80 - it's not a chinese brand; that's their entry level option). It consists of a transformer in a plastic housing that puts about 3w through a metal "blade" (which is thin but not sharpened, with a tapered slot into which the wire is inserted and rotated between your fingers.. I usually leave mine plugged in, (they get hot enough to hurt, but not really hot enough to burn you). The advantage is that you will never nick the wires, and the wire is stripped cleanly and consistently (unless it's PTFE insulated, but that stuff is dreadful to work with. FEP insulation can even be strioped, albeit less pleasantly (I have to piush both sides of the wire towards the narrow end) BUT IT DOES WORK!!!. It makes a real difference in how fast you can wire things up in general and is particularly helpful with crimp connectors where a smooth flat cut to the insulation is needed, and repeatability is king. In general, you just don't realize how time consuming it is to strip wires until you get a thermal wire stripper...\

## Do not solder crimp terminals
I have spoken to a number of people who, having decided crimping is too hard, advocate instead just soldering the wires to the terminals. Don't do this. This will defeat the purpose of the insulation crimp and introduce a weak point in wire right at it's point of highest stress. The solder will wick up between the strands, typically going a little bit beyond where the insulation crimp would be, and then solidify. Now there is a an interface between a rigid and flexible portion of the wire. And it is right outside the connector, which experiences more bending than any other part of the wire. Of course, if the wire will not be bending here, that might be okay but in typical hobby applications, where you will be unplugging and plugging in connectors during the build process, the wire is highly likely to break off there. This is also why, whenever you just tack a wire onto a PCB, it seems so damned easy to break a wire off handling the board. In many low cost consumer electronics, there are things that look like connector housings on a PCB, but there's no actual connector - the wires are just soldered to the board. These are there to act as strain relief only. For the same reason you should not solder a terminal you have also crimped on either.

### Sort-of exception
One time that I do use solder and crimp terminals together? Permanently affixing dupont clone terminals to the pins they mate with. Take the housing, and cut off the first couple of mm so that a connector can be pushed in normally, but will continue through, you can thus put the housings on from the back instead of the front.  If the other end of the wires has something crimped onto it already, feed the housing over the terminals (remember you'll need to unlatch them). Now, get out your 138C low temp solder (which will likely be in paste form - bismuth wire solder is still pretty exotic). For the paste, you want a blob on each male pin and on a bit on each female terminal. Put terminals onto the pins - you want them on as far as they normally go (which is all the way, minus the couple mm you cut off the housing). Make sure before soldering each one that they are all in the same orientation and that it matches what the housing will need. With your iron temperature set lower, and workign quickly, you can solder the terminals onto the pins without destroying the wire crimp. Don't use excessive amounts of solder, since you want to be able to slide the housing over it at the end. Finally, slide the housing down the wires - ideally it should snap into place like normal. . Using even leaded solder will get the terminal and wire too hot, softening the insulation and ruining the insulation crimp andh hence the strain relief. You must work quickly and limit the time that solder is liquid for. If you let the solder wick up the wire, you've defeated the point of this operation, which is to get the strain relief of the wire crimp, without relying on the unreliable knockoff connectors making a decent connection. The

At the start and end of any operation involving bismuth solder, if you normally use leaded solder, "wash" the tip of the iron with some normal unleaded (pure tin) solder. a few wt% lead contamination in bismuth solder will lead to a phase with a melting point under 100C forming. Not a lot of it, but you don't need much to adversely impact the physical properties of the solder at only mildly elevated temperatures.
