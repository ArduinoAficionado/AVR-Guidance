# Best Practices, Notes and Guidance
# for programming AVRs with Arduino IDE


## Sections
### [Glossary of terms](Glossary.md)
Status: Most important/relevant terms, I think, present. 
Covers terms used in this and other documents I've written about AVR parts for Arduino, as well as terms common in Arduino 
### [Best Practices guide](BestPractices.md)
Status: Mostly incomplete, some sections useful, many others absent or incomplete. 
### [Hardware Notes](HardwareNotes/)
Notes on specific hardware design decisions, one per file.
Status: Not organized or indexed, and not many items covered yet. 
### [Troubleshooting Help](Troubleshooting/)
Guidance for Arduino troubleshooting
Status: Severely incomplete, not useful yet!
### [Peripheral Guide](Peripherals/)
A quick overview of various peripherals and accomplishing common tasks using them. 
Status: Doesn't exist yet, some content written but elsewhere currently.
### [Project Planning](ProjectPlanning/)
Choosing microcontroller and core, things like that
Status: Mostly not complete, some thoughts on part selection present.
