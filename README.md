# Best Practices, Notes and Guidance
# for programming AVRs with Arduino IDE


## Sections
### [Glossary of terms](Glossary.md)
Status: Most important/relevant terms, I think, present.  
Covers terms used in this and other documents I've written about AVR parts for Arduino, as well as terms common in Arduino
### [Best Practices guide](BestPractices.md)
Status: Mostly incomplete, some sections useful, many others absent or incomplete. 
### [Hardware Notes](HardwareNotes/)
Status: Not organized or indexed, and not many items covered yet.  
Notes on specific hardware design decisions, one per file.
### [Troubleshooting Help](Troubleshooting/)
Status: Severely incomplete, not useful yet!  
Guidance for Arduino troubleshooting
### [Peripheral Guide](Peripherals/)
Status: Doesn't exist yet, some content written but elsewhere currently.  
A quick overview of various peripherals and accomplishing common tasks using them.
### [Project Planning](ProjectPlanning/)
Status: Mostly not complete, some thoughts on part selection present.  
Choosing microcontroller and core, things like that
