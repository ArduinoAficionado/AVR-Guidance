# Crimping your own "DuPont" and JST connectors

There are a million guides on this, and I'm not going to belabor the basics; there are a few key issues that cause the vast majority of the difficulties hobbyists have with these.

## A word of warning about AWG
It's sad that this is what I feel a need to cover first, but it is, unfortunately, very common for dishonest manufacturers in China and places with similar lax regulatory enforcement to intentionally try to pass wire off as thicker than it is. It is not uncommon to find wire marked "22 AWG", strip it, and discover 17 strands 0.1mm-0.11mm: it's 26 AWG, not 22! That part of the deception is bad enough (counting the strands in stranded wire every time you buy wire is a pain, plus you need to be able to measure the diameter of the strands to 0.01mm. It makes a great deal of difference if the strands are 0.1 mm or 0.14 mm in diameter; that's the difference between 23 gauge and 25 gauge). What makes this practice even more pernicious is that in order to make the wire *look* like the claimed gauge, they make the insulation thicker. Terminals were designed with normal, non-dishonest insulation thicknesses, and so the maximum size of wire you can use ends up being limited by this stupid excess insulation. It's not entirely clear the degree of awareness of this phenomenon at the level of aliexpress sellers. Many of them appear to be  If the cable-makers who produce dupont line are themselves being deceived, that explains why there exist great quantities of dupont line which fail the pull test as supplied, but which can be rectified by recrimping with a manual crimper or even, it seems, the Tozzo... Why would the manufacturer, with an automatic crimping machine that can be adjusted for wire gauge, choose to set it such that the jumpers will be of such low quality? I can imagine two scenarios:
* Cable maker is a willful participant in the deception, knows the wire is thinner than it says, and chose the actual gauge based on how thin a wire he could use such that at the smallest wire setting of his crimpng machine, that would stay in when pulled gently.
* Cable maker has been assured

## DuPont connectors
These are the most common jumper cables. More often found as female-to-female jumpoers than other gender combinations (with good reason - female terminal pushed onto male header makes a better connection, and female terminals are cheaper than male ones, while male header is not only cheaper but can be easily cut to length), though male-male is also very common because of it's usedfulness with breadboard.

For some reason, these always seemed incredibly hard to crimp. harder than other common connectors - considering how central they are to hobby electronics, this was rather frustrating. Years later, I think I've figured out all the problems (which are not well covered by most tutorials).

### No, you can't use an SN-28B crimp tool.
At least not if you want acceptable results.The same is true of 99% of other drimp tools. The best you can get is a mediocre crimp, and the more frequent result is a total failure.

**If you want to crimp dupont terminals, you must get a crimper that has a round insulation crimp die.** See the tools list for moer discussion

Most crimp connectors bend both the wire crimp and the insulation crimp tabs into a "B" shape. Accordingly, that's what most crimp tools try to do, including the SN-28B.

Unfortunately, DuPont terminals need the insulation tabs *wrapped around* the wire. The form needs to be round, not B-shaped. Actually, maybe unfortunately is the wrong word, because it's nothing to do with fortune, and everything to do with physics. They needed the terminals to fit into a hole in a housing that's only 0.1" square on the outside, but still fit around a standard header pin. If you look at all the other crimp connectors, you'll find that the housing for, say, a 0.1" pitch connector is usually considerably wider than 0.1". So that unusual insulation crimp was done for a reason!

Until recently, there weren't decent generic crimp tools with the correct shaped die available, despite how common these connectors were. As a result, people used inappropriate crimp tools that did a lousy job. You'd make a mess trying to tighten a flat-head screw with a phillips screwdriver, too. Where there was a will, there was a way, however, and the lack of tools that could make a decent crimp (short of used dupont and harwin crimpers which cost hundreds of dollars new) was not enough to deter people from, through hard work, patience, and many ruined connectors, making their own cables using tools like SN-28B's. Many of these people then wrote the guides you all see around the internet. If you replace the tool in their hands with an appropriate one, their guides are generally sound, and their crimping job far better.

Using the right crimp tool will make things far easier, and makes it possible to get good results, rather than barely acceptable ones (the examples of a "good crimp" shown in many guides with the SN-028B look like crimps that I would cut off and redo), and success rates of >95% instead of <50%. Two cheap ratchet-type crimp tools that I know of are the SN-025, and the TZ-4228B. They both do a pretty good job, though I think I get better results with the Toozo one - it is also a much more useful crimper. The SN-025 has 2 other slots for... some sort of mysterious connectors that also require the same shape crimp. The TZ-4228B, on the other hand, has 3 other slots, sized appropriately for JST-PH, JST-XH or JST-SM, and JST-VH, among others. In other words, the most popular connectors in hobby and light electronics!

### Don't get the garbage terminals
Have you noticed how some DuPont jumpers seem to be worse than others? Like, they made poor connections almost immediately and go downhill from there? That's because there are several versions of the "dupont" terminals available at hobbyist prices (a couple of cents a piece). All of these are knockoffs of a knockoff of the dupont Mini PV connector...). The design is almost identical, but the cheaper ones have a shorter wire crimp and generally seem to be using less metal wherever they can. Avoid those at all costs. They won't even crimp right in the good crimp tools because they're the wrong size! To help recognize the good ones, try to get the "half gold" plating (sometimes marketed without the "half" part - but the gold plating you see in the picture is clearly only on the mating half of the connector). The gold plating is desirable (Gold on connectors almost always is), but it's more important as a way of differentiating the good kind of terminals from garbage. The garbage terminals do not (as far as I've seen) come with gold plating. See also below point...

### Use the correct gauge of wire
AWG 22 through AWG 28 for DuPont.
A lot of dupont jumpers use thinner wire. *Many of these jumpers will actually fail the pull test* (go try it with some of the rainbow-ribbon-cable flavor of jumpers - the terminals pull right off in many cases! Note that this does not happen with the individual precrimped wires sold without the housings, at least not any of the ones I've gotten (they also use the good terminals - at least judging by the length of the terminal), but it does with most other DuPont line (which use the shorter, crappier terminals). .

## "JST" connectors
Many people online talk about a "JST connector" as though that was sufficient information for someone to go buy the matching connector. JST is a company (Japan Solderless Terminals); they make connectors; in fact they are one of the world leaders in that field. JST makes *hundreds* of types of connectors, many of which have terminals that are crimped in place, are widely used, and look identical in photos if there's no ruler next to them. You should never refer to a "JST connector", nor should you let anyone else get away with that! Specify the type of connector! When I was first getting into electronics, it once took me three tries (waiting a month for shipping each time) just to get a 2-pin connector that matched the development board I was using...

Quick descriptions
**MiniPV** - The original! First produced by Dupont, which spun out the connector division as Berg. Berg was then bought by Amphenol, one of the giants of the connector industry. They still manufacture the same terminals as always, but you have most likely never seen one. I got a small nuber of used versions of what I think are the predecessr to these - the connectors differ only in that the catch is gone, and instead the housing has a was bent 90 degrees to insert the connectoes and then straightened to latch them in plase, they fit the same header, and the housings are in all colors and have pin numbers molded into them. The main difference obvious even without disassembling them: you can see a leaf spring pressing up against the pin! Word is that they are just as good as ever, and I've got some in the mail to try out. There is are just two problems: 1. They are eye-wateringly expensive: $0.16 to upwards of $2 for, falling to the more modest pricing of $0.09 to $1.77 if you buy 100 at a time. Most are around 20-30 cents each if you buy 100 at a time! 2. Buying them is a terrible experience - catalogs are inexplicable poor, datasheets that vnedors link to from product pages, when you're looking at terminals, especially these, suddenly stop havign the part number of the thing you clicked a link from. Really, this is probably in large part because they have, minimum, 80 kinds of terminals, and iin reality I think it's well over 100 kinds assuming you count the loose vs tape packaging. They charge a premium for terminals that aren't on the tape. When you think about that, you're probably imagining how JST terminals and cheap dupont clones comewhere there's onle one end connected and it's 2 bends and the terminals are off. Nope. These you do need a pair of small wire cutters for, and they are attached end to end :-(

Once you finally get your hands on them thoigjh, they are very nice connectors. You can feel the difference as you plug and unplug them. The key is the fact that they have a little leaf spring pushing the pin and supplying the mating force.The dupont connectors rely on the brass holding it's position. It doesn't doe rthat very well, where as the spring on thereal ones is made of phosphor bronze and actiually acts like a spring, and works quite well,  They are just miles better than the cheap ones. Because like, they actually have a spring, while the cheap ones rely on a piece of stamped non-springy brass holding it's shapee. Unsurprisingly, it doesm't.  Use these for cables tht are plugged and unplugged often, and/or cause downbtime or delay if they were to get unreliable. Try to avoid having to include these things in large connectors in products you sell though, because they're just too damned expensive).

*The process of buying "DuPont" connector terminals from reputable western vendors sucks.*

**"dupont"** - The connectors we all know by that name. These appear to be copies of a design by Harwin who liked the idea of the MiniPV connectors so much, they decided to make their own, but they had to cut costs. A spring of a different metal just wasn't going to do it. They figured out a way to make it from 1 folded up piece of stamped metal. Individuals who have tried the Harwin ones found them to have little advantage over least-bad clones, and just like those, thery wore quickly and stopped making reliable connections. The ones you're likely to interact with, of course, aren't made by Harwin, but by random chinese knockoff manufacturers. Some manufacturers produce a usable termina if mediocre terminal. The best clones are "half gold" with half of the connectorthat sees the most action plated with gold flash. . The ones that are the same size but without the gold are priced similarly but, you know, not gold plated. This is typically what is used when you buy individual strands of dupont line on separate wires (not ribbon cable). The rest of the Chinese dupont connectors, including anything sold crimped to ribbon cable, are a tier lower, often fail pull-test, and are absolutely unfit for any purpose. Even the cat said they were no fun to play with.

The best of the chinese dupont connectors are fine for occasional use or as disposable cables (which such dupont line should be considered). The worst of them are imopressive in terms of how terrible they are. like, at every step where they had a chance to save the tiniest amount of money by selling a crappier product, trhey grabbed for it. It's

*The "dupont" connector terminals you buy from disreputable Chinese vendors suck.*

**TE SuperSeal** - A big honnkin' bulky connector for automotive applications. Meant to protect from moisture infitltation (I an keptical about how well it can do that without more thanhust those little rubber plugs around the wires - but it's certainly far more water resiustant than antytthing else here, and if you've got a cable (eg, multi-conductor) goingh to it, the low cost rubber jackets or boots available can be put on in addition, ziptied in place, and the resu;t seems like it could plausiblly keep water out under most conditions.) I doubt anything will make these waterproof such that you can leave them immerssed in water indefinitely, but if youre concerned about splashes, they're great, probably even rain would be okay. They are super easy to crimp with an SN-48B or SN-58B (recommend the latter, as it also replaces the SN-28B), No trouble at all. Really, there's only one problem with these, and that is the fact that they are freakin gigantic like over 2 inches long for the mnated conectors, and the largest size, 6p, at least as wide. These are very bulky, but that's the price you pay for the durability. One other tricky part is pin extraction. The female pins are easy to remove, pull red tip towards you, and that unlocks the terminals and hyou can pull them out. If they stick, you might have to pull the tip out (it goes right back in, not a problem or anything). The male pins, at the bottom of the inch-deep hole in the connectorm are whole other ball gaane. Supposedly, you can just put their hook-like extractiobn tool in and pull ut into an unlatched position and then remove the pins. I was about to to that one out of the four tries so far. On other occasions, I have had to get the retentionb catcgh removed emtirely, usually spending 10-20 minutes with  dozens of mini-screwdrivers and pin extraction tools in front of me, and usually several jammed into the connector trying to figure out exactly where the dakned catch to reklease ut is, I still don't feellike I know. Maybe I'll pull a Gordian Knot and cut one down the middle and see if that brings any enlightebnebt. I think my biggest problem is that I don't know exactkly what I'n supposed to be trying to do, becauyse I can't see inside it. Most of the one's you'll see are probably knockoffs from China. Would I use them at tha absolutermax

They also are good for main power supply lines into higher current devices. The bulk is also uswful if there will be untrained individuals around: It sends the message: "this is high power, be careful with it"

**JST-SM** These are a 2.54 mm pitch wire-to=wire connector (no wire to board), they're rated at up to 3A *with the maximum 22 gauge wire* - they should not carry the full current with anything less. That includes "22 AWG" wire that isn't actually 22 AWG aas noted above. Many of the prewired connectors are absolutely of miserable quality (they somehow have managed to find a vendor who sells terminals of a different design and rock bottom quality, to pair with their wirw 8-10 sizes smaller than what's printed on it) - particularly common for the 2-pin ones. Which, unfortumnately are what people are most likelty to want to put power through. Fortunately, after the TE connectors, these are the easiest ones to crimp. The Tozzo and a SN-28B or SN-58B will do the trick without particular difficulty, but the thinner jaws of the Tozzo make it easier to see what I'm doing and again make it my preferred tool.

These connectors are okay, but only okay. Their biggest selling point is that they are the de facto standard for addressable LEDs. Unfortunately, the direction of the pins is often  exactly what you don't want (you want to feed poweer and data into one end; with the standard pinout, the tail end always has +5V, ground and data on pins sticking out. Not good. 5v is rarely dangeous, but these thingscan pull enough current rthat they are frequenrly backed by beefy supplies, so a near short would pose a fire hazard). While I don'e love the connectoers, . But there isnt a good alternative available with a nice latchm, polarization, low cost, and ready availability. fact, there are wound up swapping thosse for 5p ones of the opposite gender (two outer pins are A second ground and +19v, which is fed to a buck converter at the start of each string.))

I have not been terribly happy with how these have worked out, I'm procuring some Micro-fit 3.0 connectors to compare with these.

**JST-xH** where x is V (3.98mm), X (2.5mm), P (2.0mm), Z (1.5mm). These range from the beefy VH down to the tiny ZH. All have headers in both SMT anbd through-hole versionsm except for the XH, which doesnb't ave SMT ones. The largest three of them are easily crimped - the Tozzo 4228B has a slot for each!  These are widely used in all manner of electronics. They are some of the most common connectors. VH is somethat uncommon, as us ZH, but I've seen all of them in consumer electronics. PH and XH are ubiquitrous in connections from battery packs to PCBs. and PH is very common as a board-to-board connection, often on the end of white-and-pink or white-and-blue ribbon cable  (where each stranbd has a different pattern of opink or blue marks on it). These are all good choices when they meet your needs for a wire to board conectior, and headers for 2-10+ pin lengths are available. There are also wire-to-wire versions (ie, a male pin and housing) for both XH and PH. The XH eems kinda bulky in that form as you get to larger connectors, while PH does not. are also good choices for wire-to-wire connectors on these grounds. I would pick XH over DuPont connectors for any situation in which the other of the pins on either end is not going to change (that is, non-prototyping situations). You may need to go to unofficial sources (selling third party parts) to get the SMT 2-pin headers.

You need something specialize to crimp the tiny the ZH. The IWISS 3220M was decent, as was the SN-03, and they're totally viablem, if slow work, with manual crimpers too. Use the 1 mm slot.

**JST-SH** is the finest pitch crimp connector JST makes. They make SMT headers only (most board houses can't put holes that close together). I've never seen them in the wild, but they're what you use when you need a particularly dense connector, this is the most widely available and common option (I am intentionally omitting any strange or exotic connectors from this discussion - let's stick to what we're likely to encounter, see for sale, and consider useing). These are used in some small drones.

They work well endough, but my god, they are incredibly hard to crimp at home. They are just. too. small. The problem is holding them, more than anything else, Even a manual crimper with the necessary 0.7mm wide slot, you're still trying to crimp something tyou need tweezerts to hold onto. I have not been very successful. Try to aboid having to use these - or at least having to crimp the damned things.

**JST-GH** - The GH line is a rather fancy set of connectors. SMT headers only, in vertical or horizontal versions, 1.25nn pitch. Totally differebt desigh, Where the othgers have the spring in the terminal, and a pin in the receoptacle, the GH has a flat ternubak tgat is inserted between two jaws onthe receptacle. These also have a LATCH, to ensure that they stay in even in high vibration environments. Unsurprisingly, even the cheapest knockoffs several times the price of other connectors. Use it when you need a fine pitch connector, but also worry about the connector retention due to vibration or other factors. These are widely used in Drones, and some special purpose consumer electronics. While you need a smaller crimp tool than most, these are less burtally difficult to crimp than you'd expect, maybe even easier than a ZH, because ythe flat blade is easier to hold onto, and becayse it's flat rather than hollow, you don't need to worry about crushing it luike you do the ZH and most others as you try to hold it in place wuth pliers, tweezers, or some hybrid gripping tool.

**"Micro JST"** - The so-called "Micro JST 1.25" connector looks like someone hit a JST-ZH with a shrink-ray, except that the holes are squared off instead of rounded on the housing. This is often the fastest way to tell which is which. Available in wire to board and wire to wire, they are a viable option, and can be crimped with the IWISS-3220M with difficulty. Cheap and abundant, either buy crimped cables (you can get ones with only one end crimped, too, if the other end is going to have a friendlier connector or no connector at all), or are comfortable with the amount of crimping of tiny tiny terminals involved before you decide to start using these in a design; male terminals are much easier to crimp. They are available with both SMT and through-hole headers. The former is recommended. 1.25mm pitch is just a hair too tight for comfort, and it's very easy to get solder bridges. The really surprising thing about these though is.... they are not made by JST. JST makes no such connector. These are made by some nameless Chinese manufacturer, and they get sold as "Micro JST" because anyone who looked at them would be sure they were made by JST.

**MX2.0** - These are wire-to-wire connectors. They feel cheap. They ARE cheap. Very cheap, actually. They're available up to at least 6p, though the 2p form is by far the most common, used to connect batteries in some consumer electronics where space is tight. Their claim to fame is that they are thin. 2.7mm or so for a pair of them connected - the side with the female pins has a slight ridge near the wire ebd which can be shaved off to get it to around 2.54mm (eg, 0.1") for passing through a narrow slot. They are thinner than any of the others here, which are at their smallest 3mm thick for the smaller of the halves, and 3.25mm for the mated wire-to-wore connector ("MicroJST" being the runner up), and these can carry 2A of current as well. Great for things where you are tightly constrained on connector thicknesss, and might have been tempted to use a DuPont conector for a long term connection just because they are thin. Don't do that. You will regret it

They are on the edge of the Tozzo 4228B, I wasn't very happy with results. Honestly, the PAD-11 felt like no slot was quite right. They crimp no problem in the IWS-3220M, though. just make sure it is positioned correctly: The biggest problem I had initially is that I would isert them too far towards the wire end into the crimp tool. I was getting decoyed by what *looks* like the tabs that crinmp on the wire, but is actually a structural part of the connector (both sides have it) As long as you crimp only the crimp tabs and not the body of the terminals, they're hard to work with, but this one does kind of demonstrate hoe JST-centric  some of these tools are. The PAD-21 seems to have a slot for everything JST, but as soon as you go to a different manufacturer, their dies don

There are three general crimp tool styles for non-machanized crimping.  the "Pliers" (ratchet pliers_) style, which are the most common, and are essentially pliers with precision shaped jaws for crimping instead of holding. Often nultiple sets of different jaws are available for onecrimp tool. These are often not compatible with equivalent devices from other manufacturers, unfortunately. The adjusable ratchet gives you some measure or repreatabilityin terms of the pressure you apply. You can crimp pretty dast, especially with the larger sizes of connecrtor with an approipriate ratcher crimp.

The Anvil style of ratchet crimop is less common, bringing the handles together forced the moving die away from the person holding it, wherit engages a matching anvil. This mechanism isused byh many of the official crimp tools - although the ones they use are far fancier and specialized than say, an IWS=3220. 3220 there wins for smaller sizes because it's easier to get theings positioned in, whicch is always the problem when crimping.

The "manual" ones are a type of pliers - but they only crimp one set of tabs at a time. The two top dogs are the Hozan P-707 (which has a dupont insulation crimp die), and the Engineer PAD-11 (which has 3 die sets. Unfortunately, it has 6 sizes per die, and 12 total sizes, so if you can find the largest and smallest, the middle size becomes redundant - but almost everything relevant to hobby electronics is covered by the small die set (the most notable exception being that none of the die sets feature a slot for DuPont - it is aimed squarely at JST connectors.) Both of these tools are in the $70-80 range. You crimp the wire crimp first, then you move the wire and terminal to a new slot in the die and crimp the insulation. At both steps, positioning the wire and connector takes longer, and hence they are slower and more labor intensive compared to ratchet crimps. As you might expect, they also give you far more control, and can get good results under adverse conditions (wire with abnormal insulation thickness, multiple wires, pushing the limits of the size of wire, etc) when ratchet crimpers will either break the wires of fail to crimp and excellent results under more typical conditions. It is striking how much more expensive they are compared to ratchet crimpers, which are a more complicated design, but they are built to a much higher standard of quality.These give you a great deal more control, mnaking them poarticularly well suited for ceses where the wires have uunusual thickness or other properties, or where you need to get multiple things into one terminal ands have it still make decent connections. On the other hand, it's a lot more work, and goes much slower. The Hozan P707h is known to do an excellent job on the round insulation crimp for dupont connectors, though it needs two actions to crimp the wide tabs if the wire crimp. While some people are willing to use manual crimpers for routine crimps. I consider them to be too time consuming for most tasks, but for particulary emanding crimp jobs (multiople wires or wire + component lead goinf into one, for example, I would always pick the manual one.

TYhey can also be very useful as a way of making poorllly crimped terminals make more robuist connections. It will generalkly improve crap dupont line to go over the wire crimp with a manual crimper (but as TZ4228B or SN025 also improves them - they're always crimped too loosely; my theory is that they back off the crimp force to reduce wear on the crimping machines, (remember, they're trying to earn a profit, when they;re selling jumpers forpennies a piece.

### DuPont and "DuPont MX2.54" are not the same
The MX style has a latch on the housing. You might assume the terminals themselves are interchangible. They're not. MX housings only take MX terminals, and non-MX housings only take non-MX terminals.

### Specific considerations for these sort of connectors
You will normally have to squeeze the insulation tabs together to make it fit the tool. Depending on the thickness of the wire, you might want to do this with the wire in place, or just put it into the tool that way, and then insert the wire. For some crimp tools, particularly manual ones, you may even need to give a similar treatment to the tabs that crimp the wire! (though never enough that tyou'd want the wire in place for it). Usually no tools are needed, but if you're trying to make it hold the wire in, a small pair of pliers may be useful. You just want to bend them enough to ensure that they go into the crimp tool die comfortably, not any more than that.
This is different from DuPont connectors - those sometimes need the insulation tabs bent slightly to fit the tool. With the JST ones, they almost always do, especially using manual tools

Be careful with JST-GH and "micro JST" connectors - I have seen the latter sold as the former (the seller appeared very confused when I told him that micro JST is not the same thing as JST GH - and if you look on JST's website, yeah, JST-GH is the only 1.25mm pitch wire to board connector with crimp terminals they make... it would appear that the seller had done that, and concluded that's what they were selling, even though JST-GH looks nothing like "micro JST")

### Size vs difficulty to crimp
Everything from JST-PH on up is easy to crimp (The TZ-4228B does it no problem, as do many other tools). For smaller ones, you need either a more specialized ratchet crimper like the SN-03B (I am waiting on mine to see how well it actually works), a manual crimp tool (see below) or the eye-wateringly expensive tools from the manufacturer. They get significantly harder to work with as they get smaller, because of their tendency to twist while you close the connector jaws on them.

### Precrimped wires
You can get all of these terminals pre-crimped onto wires. Sometimes sold as "terminal line" (that's a good search term). The only type of connector where poorly crimped terminal line is common is the "DuPont" type as I described above, and decent versions are available (most of the stuff that isn't made with ribbvon cable is fine!). Needless to say,terminal line made with real MiniPV terminals is very exotic, and you would never pay what they'd need to charge. probably upwards of 30 cents per wire if they used the cheapest non-gold-plated terminals and paired it with wire rthat actually met spec.  I've yet to encounter a bad batch of JST terminal line, whereas I'd been building electronics for years before I encountered good DuPont line! On the other hand, precrimpoed cables of all types are a bit less consisten (terminal line on average is better than similar specs already inserted into a housing, Terminal line is very common for the JST Wire to board connectors. for the Wire to Wrie ones, it's common, but not as ubiquitous. The one exception to the "JST precrimped cables are usually dfecentis  JST-SM - bad JST-SM pre-crimped connectors are very common. I'm starting to suspect that JST SM is just a poorlty designed connector and kind of sucks no matter what. I havwe some Micro Fit 3.0 kits on the way"

### Beware pre-wired JST-SM connectors
These are sold in abundance because of their use for LED striops. Some of these are fine, and can be a time saver (or, really more of a "time wpent getting comfortable crimping connectors" saver - JST-SM is probably the easiest of the connectors listed here to crimp) - but make sure you get ones with the wire gauge listed, and measure it to be sure when you get it. I have seen 30 gauge wire stamped "AWG 22" - and seen such wires used without recognizing their insufficiency have the red insulation baked black by heating of the too-thin conductor!

The same holds for any pre-wired connector, but the JST-SM series seem to be the worst-afflicted by this sort of cheaping-out, likely because of the mass market for LED strips, which is unfortunately a rather demanding task. Very few people try to put a full 3A through a dupont connector, but people try to put more than that through a JST-SM connector all the time.

### Multiple wires in one terminal.
Unlike DuPont connectors, in the larger sizes, provided you crimp with a manual crimp tool (a ratchet crimp is a non-starter here - it will apply too much force and break off the wires) you can stuff multiple wires into one terminal, crimp it down, and have a decent chance of it working! This is often not the ideal approach - but it's not even an OPTION with the dupont and clones thereof because of the different insulation crimp.

## The Thermal wire stripper
Unless you are very good with wire strippers, and enjoy stripping large numbers of wires without nicking the conductors, I would recommend getting a thermal wire strippeR. In general, but particularly if you are gonna be crimping a lot of connectors. I have a PTS-10 from Patco ($80 - it's not a chinese brand; that's their entry level option). It consists of a transformer in a plastic housing that puts about 3w through a metal "blade" (which is thin but not sharpened, with a tapered slot into which the wire is inserted and rotated between your fingers.. I usually leave mine plugged in, (they get hot enough to hurt, but not really hot enough to burn you). The advantage is that you will never nick the wires, and the wire is stripped cleanly and consistently (unless it's PTFE insulated, but that stuff is dreadful to work with. It makes a real difference in how fast you can wire things up in general and is particularlt helpful with crimp connectors where a smooth flat cut to the insulation is needed, and repeatability is king.. You don't realize how time consuming it is to strip wires until you get a thermal wire stripper...\

## So what are these manual crimpers, anyway?
Manual crimpers exist, mostly made in Japan, though there are a few chinese clones.

## Do not solder crimp terminals
I have spoken to a number of people who, having decided crimping is too hard, advocate instead just soldering the wires to the terminals. Don't do this. This will defeat the purpose of the insulation crimp and introduce a weak point in wire right at it's point of highest stress. The solder will wick up between the strands, typically going a little bit beyond where the insulation crimp would be, and then solidify. Now there is a an interface between a rigid and flexible portion of the wire. And it is right outside the connector, which experiences more bending than any other part of the wire. Of course, if the wire will not be bending here, that might be okay but in typical hobby applications, where you will be unplugging and plugging in connectors during the build process, the wire is highly likely to break off there. This is also why, whenever you just tack a wire onto a PCB, it seems so damned easy to break a wire off handling the board. In many low cost consumer electronics, there are things that look like connector housings on a PCB, but there's no actual connector - the wires are just soldered to the board. These are there to act as strain relief only. For the same reason you should not solder a terminal you have also crimped on either
