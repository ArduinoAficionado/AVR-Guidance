# Best Practices for AVRs in Arduino
Poor programming practices are endemic to the Arduino community, and result in poor sketch performance, wasted flash/RAM, difficulty porting sketches to other parts. These can also make your code difficult for others to understand, for example if you post on the Arduino forus requesting assitance. These can also increase the liklihood of bugs that result in the MCU crashing or resetting, as well. For best results, read this guide **BEFORE** ytou write the sketch (this is not intended as a debugging guide, but rather a set of practices to reduce the need for debugging)

This guide applies to all AVR parts supported by Arduino via official board packages or third party hardware packages. (if you are the author of a third party hardware package that supports parts not listed, and want to be included on this list, please contact me).

## Terminology
`classic AVR` refers to any AVR part with the old syle peripherals - specifically, each port is controlled by registers named PORTx, PINx, DDRx (where x is the letter representing the port in question). The classic AVRs have very similar peripherals - they basically have a set of peripherals chosen from a list of standard peripherals (though there are a few parts with one or more unique peripherals - for example, the tiny x5 and x61 series both have a "high-speed timer" instead of the usual Timer1, though there are significant differences between the timers on those parts). See [classicperipheraltable.md](this table of Classic AVR peripherals and which parts have them) for a full list (this table has not been created as of 4/14/2020, but it will be)
* `megaavr` refers to any AVR part with the new-style peripherals - this currently includes the tinyAVR 0-series and 1-series, the megaAVR 0-series, and the AVR-DA series (which appears to be what would have been the megaAVR 1-series had Microchip not bought Atmel and applied their naming conventions to it)
## Use the right hardware package
