# Choosing and sourcing parts
Sometimes, you don't have much of a choice. If you only work with AVRs (that's pretty much the case for myself, because I have dreams in AVR assembly at this point; think "the matrix"), it's not hard to go from project requirements to the necessary part number for the microconctroller; that's covered elsewhere. But what about everything else? Once you've picked them, where to source them? What should you source from digikey or other reputable suppliers in the western world? What should you buy straight from china to save a bundle? 

I will cover these in reverse order, as the "where to source" will (eventually) be a lot shorter than my suggestions about parts.

## Sourcing
Some things, only a madman or someone with more money than sense would buy from those "reputable western distributors" - they can be sourced direct from China with little sacrifice except shipping time from AliExpress, eBay international sellers, or other such marketplaces. There are other things that only madman or an "easy mark"`*` would buy from China direct, and which is better bought through reputable western distributors or the manufacturer directly. It's actually pretty straightforward. 

One thing to remember is that the slope of the price vs quantity graph is far shallower over there (no clue why - I know it's not when you're having them make custom PCBAs. It may just be that the marketplace sellers buy everything by the reel, and are just competing on price, so the prices of any quantity tends towards the unit price in reel-quantities). While the premium that Digikey demands for one of something is often eye-watering, the discounts to be had on AliExpress from buying a thousand of something instead of 5 or 10 can be vanishingly small.

`*` An "Easy Mark" is con-man lingo for someone who's going to be easy to rob.
### Integrated Circuits
It's usually pretty simple to determine where to buy the IC's you need. 

When it's manufactuered by a western company, unless it's so old that the datasheets you see are scanned in from the original papyrus scrolls (only a slight exaggeration - you know the type of datasheet I'm talking about, IC designed in the late 70's or early 80's, barely readable with the content all crooked)... you should probably get them from a western distributor. Aliexpress et. al. is where you get fake ICs that don't work correctly. When the IC is so cheap from Digikey that it's not worth their time to rip off, there is often little to be saved. AVR microcontrollers in particular, when sold as the bare chip, should be avoided by those who want the part they bought, and would like it to be in working order too. I've heard of ATtiny13's sold as ATtiny85's (with the part number having been ground off and ATtiny85 inscribed in it's place!), and mysterious "ATtiny412" devices that belived that they were ATtiny416's and acted like it (if you want my guess, they were a factory screwup that was thrown away, and then retrived by someone picking through the factory's waste, and sold on to the poor victims overseas via aliexpress sellers who had no idea they were bad). 

There are also stories of crooked middlemen becoming aware of a shortage, buying a bunch of something in the same package on the surplus market, and srraight up remarking the parts. Being overseas, they can generally do this kind of thing without fearing any actual punishment. The actual sellers, I suspect, are rarely complicit in this, and are simply unsophisticated w/regards to what they are selling (the same is true of many ebay sellers in the USA) - that is why this problem is far worse for bare chips than it is for IC's. Almost anyone who sells Arduino-like boards online knows enough to at least be able to plug it into a computer and upload blink, and will complain to their supplier if it doesn't work. And the seller is the individual who is most likely to take the heat from the angry customer and/or the marketplace they're selling on, and something like parts being straight up fake is not something they can chalk up to a miscommunication with the buyer (as opposed to the misleading listing titles for nano/micro/pro mini clones, which are crafted to show up for searches for any of the three, and which take careful study to make sure you're getting a Nano with a 328p, not a 168p). 

There's one exception to the rule on "western manufacturers' parts" and that is when the western manufacturer has discontinued or marked it NRND, and it's getting hard to get for a reasonable price. Sometimes, upon searching the market place sites, you will find a great abundance of them at a bargain basement price - they may be getting phased out in the west, but they're still in widespread use in China and the rest of the world. The bargain-priced ones you find in this case are likely not made by the original manufacturer, but, they often work fine (they're usually cheap enough that they're not worth counterfeiting).  

On the other hand, if it's made by a Chinese company (for example, if you want a CH4340N to add USB-serial functionality to the design that you're hand soldering, and you don't want to spend an arm and a leg), you generally don't get the option of buying anywhere other than the direct-from-China marketplaces, since the western vendors don't sell them. Many parts are simply not available to anyone who doesn't speak - or at least read and write - Chinese, but the most common parts can be had on the market place sites. 

Finally, don't ever buy an "IC Kit" for hobbyists. Most of the IC's in those are junk that you'll never use. They're also not even cheap if you were going tu use all the damned parts in them (probably because anyone damned fool enough to buy one isn't shopping around anyway!)


## Passsives
In my experience, though the prices on ebay and aliexpress sound lovely.... if you do the math and buy the same amount, Digikey Mouser, etc are actually around the same price on stuff like reistors and ceramic caps. There is very little need to buy tantalum caps these days (not only are they mostly superfluous, the tantalum that they get their name from is sourced from violent warlords in third world countries and mined by slave labor, so the price premium you pay over ceramics goes towards emisserating a nation that frankly has more than its share of misery to begin with). For ceramic capacitors, I can't remember seeing a price difference that was more than 2:1 and the specs on the China-Direct ones were dubious. Aluminum electroyltics are often cheaper direct from china in event that you need large bulk capacitors; don't count on them lasting as long as something from a western electronics supplier, but they're typically good enough. This

Kits (that is, for example "30 values of resistors 10 pcs per value" are usually cheaper from china, as are large (power) resistors. 

SMD crystals (the small ones. eg, 5032 and smaller) are available from china for a fraction of what you have to pay in the West. But you'll be lucky to get any specification other than the frequency with it. Load capacitance? Nope, even if you ask them, they don't know (consistent with my "the sellers on marketplaces are often clueless" theory). The price differential is often so large though, that it's worth getting them from aliexpress, accepting that you'll have to do some trial and error to find the load right load capacitor values (I mean, more than usual, unless you're one of those people who calculates out the exact load capacitor values before building anything. No, I don't do that either, I havn't even been able to get a straight answer out of the MIT professor I've been doing work for who teaches a class on crystals to EE majors, regarding some truly basic questions on this subject), and you will never know whether they're rated to work in the freezer at -20C  or at 90C right above the furnace, they're 10 cents instead of 50 to 80 cents. Ocillators (or "active crystals" as many listings refer to them as) cost a fortune no matter where you buy them, so the savings is rarely worth it. 

## Connectors, switches, and project boxes
The prices in china *bury* the western suppliers. You want to get those from China. Electromechanical gizmos and purely mechanical stuff is invariably cheaper from the chiense vendors, *often by an order of magnitude*. 

## LEDs
As with electromechanical stuff, LEDs are virtually always cheaper to get direct from china, and the price differeces are among the largest I've seen for electronics, probably the largest. I cannot fathom who the hell is paying Digikey and their suppliers 50+ cents for a single SMD LED instead of buying it for half a cent from China, but it's apparently enough to justify the catalog space they take up. 1206 LEDs were the first part that I bought a full reel of, as it happens - it was something absurd like $5 or something, so cheap that it wasn't even worth it to buy less than a damned reel.

## Discrete semiconductors
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's be extra careful, as we're about to walk onto the casino floor..."
Discrete semiconductors - that is, diodes, transistors, and the like - are one of the few cases where there isn't an obvious right answer on where to get them - the savings from getting them, direct can be incredible (order of magnitude is not uncommon). One has to assume that these parts must be fake (either that, or there's some other funny business happening; for example, MicroCommercialCorp (MCC `**`) has a long-standing practice of recycling the part numbers of major manufacturrers, particuluarly Vishay, for their knockoffs). On the other hand, sometimes it makes a lot of sense when the savings is large, your use case not particularly demanding, and when you are able to sanity check the quality of the parts and absorb the cost it they're crap.

With that warning out of the way, particularly for cheap, low end parts, direct from china is great. You want 300 basic schottky signal diodes for under a penny each shipped? No problem. There is a widely-copied dual signal diode in TO-23; I use it in many of my designs (since 2021, this replaced the SOD-123 signal diodes in new designs) because they're low cost and easier to place and solder than other packages (they don't wobble on their leads like SOD-123 can). I don't know who makes the ones I'm using now, and I don't really care, but they most certainly didn't come from digikey....

Never buy a "transistor kit" or "diode kit". Not from anywhere. Those kits are for the easy marks - they almost invariably are filled with obsolete and nearly obsolete parts (ex, power darlingtons, which were pretty cool 30-40 years ago but are blown away by rice-grain sized MOSFET now) and/or with many varieties of nearly identical part (For example. those diode ktis containing 1N4001, 1N4002. 1N4003, through 1N4007) which could be replaced by a single one. I have seen kits that did have decent parts in them, it's true - but still, I'd look down the list and see a pack of a dozen types of MOSFET... and almost half of them could be matched with a comparable part from the list and eliminated, while there were huge swathes of the parameter space of readily available parts missing from the selection. 

`**` MCC is actually not a bad company, technically speaking. I don't know where or how they got their trench MOSFET fabrication technology, but it's damned nice. Their low Vgs offerings are particularly impressive. The gate capacitace is often on the high side, but the Rds(on) is top tier.

### Tact pushbuttons
The 3x6mm ones are my usual go to, the ones that normally hae either a white or red button. EziUsin on Aliexpress has them in all the colors of the rainbow for only a small premium (and other sellers have them for exorbitant premiums. If I need a tall button extension, I use the 6x6mm ones, while if board space is an issue, there's a 3x3 line. You can get all manner of bizarro buttons, but.... why....? These are common, cheap, and durable.
