# Best Practices, Notes and Guidance
# for programming AVRs with Arduino IDE


## Sections
### (Glossary.md)[Glossary of terms]
Status: Most important/relevant terms, I think, present. 
Covers terms used in this and other documents I've written about AVR parts for Arduino, as well as terms common in Arduino 
### [BestPractices.md](Best Practices guide)
Status: Mostly incomplete, some sections useful, many others absent or incomplete. 
### [HardwareNotes/](Hardware Notes)
Notes on specific hardware design decisions, one per file.
Status: Not organized or indexed, and not many items covered yet. 
### [Troubleshooting/](Troubleshooting help)
Guidance for Arduino troubleshooting
Status: Severely incomplete, not useful yet!
### [Peripherals/](Peripheral guide)
A quick overview of various peripherals and accomplishing common tasks using them. 
Status: Doesn't exist yet, some content written but elsewhere currently.
### [ProjectPlanning/](Project Planning)
Choosing microcontroller and core, things like that
Status: Mostly not complete, some thoughts on part selection present.
